        overview: "Paisu Pok Lake is a beautiful blue lake in Banggai, Indonesia that was still a hidden gem until very recently, although pictures of this amazing lake are going viral all over social media now so it seems the word is officially out. We visited Paisupok recently and it’s just as nice as it looks in the photos. It’s not very hard to get to there if you’re already traveling in Sulawesi, which you should, because Sulawesi is a huge island with so many wonderful things to see and do. This travel guide will explain how to get to Paisu Pok Lake in Banggai, and everything else you need to know before you go!",

                text: "Paisu Pok Lake is located on Peleng island, which is part of the Banggai Islands Regency in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. To get there, the first step is getting to Luwuk. There are daily, non-stop flights to the Luwuk airport (LUW) from Makassar in South Sulawesi. If you’re coming from Bali, Jakarta, or somewhere else in Indonesia, then you’ll have to transit in Makassar on the way to Luwuk. You can shop for flights on Skyscanner.",

                text: "Paisu Pok Lake is just as nice as it looks in pictures. We first saw it in the morning, and we thought that was stunning, but the color and clarity gets even better when the sun shines on it. You can rent a small boat, canoe, or standup paddleboard for exploring the lake, or you can swim and snorkel in it. The water is cold in the morning, but by midday it felt perfect and it was a great escape from the heat and humidity of Sulawesi. The inside of the lake is almost as beautiful as the outside, with fallen logs and rocks that give it personality, and the color of the water seems to change with the lighting. It’s extremely clear, almost like glass, and you can usually see all the way to the bottom, even though the water is actually more than 10 meters deep in some places! In case you’re wondering, I didn’t add any extra color or saturation to the pictures in this blog post. This is how the water really looks. The name ‘Paisu Pok’ means ‘black water’ or ‘dark water’ according to the locals. There are only a handful of other places like this in Indonesia, such as the Labuan Cermin blue lake in Kalimantan, or the smaller Danau Kaco lake in Sumatra."

        overview: "Sanur is known for being one of the most quiet and family friendly areas of Bali, but there are also plenty of good things to do there. Families will love the laid back atmosphere and chill restaurants at Sanur Beach, and the sunrise views here are some of the best you can find anywhere in Bali. This sleepy seaside town on the southeast coast of Bali was one of the original birthplaces of tourism on the island, and it’s still popular for its nice hotels, shopping, breakfast, massages, and easy access to the Nusa islands.

The combination of a cool morning breeze, birds chirping, fishermen wading out on the reef, the Mount Agung volcano in the distance, and the overall sunrise display here is just plain magic. Sometimes you can even see the distant outline of Mount Rinjani in Lombok. Sunrise on the beach is definitely one of the best things to do in Sanur! It’s a great way to start the day."

For yoga lovers, there’s a free morning yoga class every day at Pantai Karang that starts at 7:30 AM. Everyone is welcome, so just join in with a mat or towel."

We traveled all over the state recently and visited many of the best slot canyons in Arizona, including the touristy Antelope Canyons in Page, plus some relatively unknown hikes that are off the beaten path even for most locals. Some of these slots are easy hikes that you can do with kids, while others are a bit more challenging. Here’s our complete list of the best ones to see!",

This is a great canyon, but its popularity has brought some drawbacks with it. Guided tours are required to see Upper Antelope, and they sell out very easily since it’s a smaller canyon that’s super popular with photographers. You’ll normally have to book weeks or even months in advance to get a spot on a tour. Upper Antelope is mainly known for its dramatic sunbeams, where rays of light shine through the narrow roof of the canyon, illuminating the dust in the air. It’s a neat effect, but personally I think it’s a little overrated, and I say that even as a photographer.",

Just like the Upper Canyon, a tour is required to see Lower Antelope, although it’s slightly cheaper and less likely to sell out. The tours are also less rushed in the Lower Canyon. This is because it’s a bigger canyon with more to see. The Lower Canyon has wonderful colors, and it’s full of twisting passageways and interesting rock features that are great for photos. We actually enjoyed the Lower Canyon more than the Upper. It’s extremely photogenic, and the tour is a better overall experience in many ways."
